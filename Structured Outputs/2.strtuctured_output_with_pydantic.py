                         Since is has 150cc so you can't go rough above 70km/hr or else bear with the low mileage. To maintain better be at 50-60km/hr.
                         My got 35km/litre. Every part has a replacement date, Oil is must to be changed on a fixed interval or can lead to engine break.

Battery life is very good (not great, i have had find x8 pro), cameras are very dependable and more natural, i see things have changed with samsung, it used to be over saturated (not ultra processed like x8 pro or xiaomi 15 with leica vivid which i have had in the past). what i liked most is the software, oneui have come a long way its very polish and lot of ai stuff are very usable. Also samsung software is really good they are not bloatware anymore. for example the browser, files and note app are way better than google ones. Lot of attention to detail compared to chinese software. s-pen is handy, but im not sure if i will be using it much. """)
